## About
This is my early projects in react native. This is a simple recipe finder app that gets data from a local "dummy-data.js" file and displays them in the screen. I used tab navigation, and stack navigation for this. Also you can save your favorites with "async storage package". This particular project helped me learn tab, stack navigation and many more things about react native. I am loving the journey and hoping to grow even more.
